# 🛠️ WordPress Playground – Custom Themes, Plugins & CPTs

Welcome to my WordPress dev repo! Just me messing around with custom themes, plugins, and custom post types (CPTs) while learning the ropes of WordPress development.

## 🚀 What’s Inside

- **Custom Themes** – From scratch themes with clean structure, proper enqueueing, and responsive design.
- **Plugins** – Hand-coded plugins with simple functionalities (no boilerplate junk).
- **Custom Post Types** – Registered manually via `functions.php` or plugins, including taxonomies and metaboxes.

## 🧩 Technologies Used

- PHP
- WordPress (duh)
- HTML/CSS/JS
- A sprinkle of jQuery
- Maybe some ACF (Advanced Custom Fields) depending on the project

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wordpress-projects.git
